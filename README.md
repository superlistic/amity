# Amity

Amity is a way of staying social in these isolated times. With Amity we want to make working from home more fun, exciting and socially rewarding.

This project was the graduation project of Johan Strand and Viktor Norman, from the '</Salt>' fall 2020 bootcamp. By utilizing WebRTC and sockets the chat and video response is very quick between the users. 

### Features of our two week MVP are:
- Matchmaking between users
- Text and video chat between users
- Authorized login with user accounts 
- Chat suggestions of conversation topics
