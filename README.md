# Amity

Amity is a way of staying social in these isolated times. With Amity we want to make remote work more fun, exciting and socially rewarding. By utilizing WebRTC and sockets the users connect each other randomly through our matchmaking. Thereafter the two connected users have quick real time communication with both video and chat.

This project was the graduation project of Johan Strand and Viktor Norman, from the Salt fall 2020 bootcamp. 

### Features of our two week MVP are:
- Matchmaking between users
- Text and video chat between users
- Authorized login with user accounts 
- Chat suggestions of conversation topics
