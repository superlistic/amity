        The problem with social media today is that it is not social!
      </h4>
      <p className="about__text">
        What do i mean by that? Instagram is pictures with likes and comments,
        twitter are tweets limited to 150 characters. Messenger and Discord are
        limited to your social circle. What we need during this digital age is
        good communication with friends and family (1), but also interesting and
        exciting connections with new friends(2). We aim to solve both of these
        important aspects of our social lives, to make life better! Our idea
        with Amity is to solve the two problems above. The first problem by
        designating time in you schedule together with friends on your
        friendslist. The second problem we adress by our matchmaking-system
        pairing people based on a multitude of factors like interest,
        preferences, personality, paired history and so forth. What happens when
        two people are “connected”? We provide possibilities of chat,
        video/audio calls, topics of discussion, as well as the ability to solve
        challenges together. All in order to establish a better relationship and
        at the same time grow and get stimulated together. With Amity you can
        choose your preferred way and time to be digitally social. Creating and
        maintaining a safe space of positivity is our top concern. Amity can
        help organisations grow through improved relations, help people improve
        their social skills and be a fun and exciting way of interacting with
        others!
